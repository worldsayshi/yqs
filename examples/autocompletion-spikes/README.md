Here are some example scripts if I ever get to turn this into proper autocomplete. The more I think about it the more I find edge cases. So it is probably not worth the effort.

Unsolved problems:
- Is it possible to make context dependent autocomplete?
    - I.e. autocomplete that can properly complete `cat somefile.yaml | yq`
    - There are probably ways to achieve it but can't imagine a simple enough solution.
